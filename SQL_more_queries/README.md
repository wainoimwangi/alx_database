# SQL_more_queries Repository

This scripts are tackling tasks on the following topics; SQL join and Grant user permissions in MySQL

SQL join is a crucial operation used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. It allows you to retrieve data that is distributed across different tables and create a unified result set for analysis, reporting, or further processing.

Granting user permissions in MySQL involves assigning specific privileges to a user account, which determines what actions that user can perform on databases and tables
